# AutoSizeText
Autosize text in labels and text boxes for Godot, just like in Unity.

## About
I was always missing the Unity function of auto-sizing text inside labels/text fields in Godot.  
Intentionally made in GDScript to provide maximum compatibility (even in some of our GDScript only projects).  
Just use the provided UI elements in your project.
